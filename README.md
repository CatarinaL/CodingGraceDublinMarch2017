# Coding Grace @ Microsoft -  Dublin March 2017

1. Set up a Azure Notebook account 
 - Go to notebooks.azure.com
 - Set up an account. This should just take 2 minutes.

2. Set up a new library. 
 - Give it a name like "tidyverse" or "Rworkshop". 
 - Fill in the details that suit you.

3. Add a new notebook to the library. 
 - Specify the name AND the language. (We are using R obviously).
 
4. Test that it is working.
 - Type in `dim(iris)`. Hit the "play" (correctly "run cell") button at the top (just under "cell" to the right)/
 - you should get an answer of 150 and 5 printed out.
